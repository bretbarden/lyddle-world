Suddenly, Lovleen heard an odd noise in the distance. She looked around and saw a spark of fire in the valley. She realized that the fire was quickly spreading and could be dangerous. She was scared, but she knew she had to do something to help before it was too late. 

Lovleen ran as fast as she could through the meadows and down the mountain. After what seemed like forever, she reached the valley and saw the fire was out of control. She wouldn't be able to put it out on her own, so she grabbed a nearby branch and ran to the nearest village.
