Introduction
Once upon a time there lived a wily, 8 year old girl in Brooklyn named Melanie. She was inspired by the endless opportunities to explore and discover in the great outdoors, and adored the prospect of solving math problems. Melanie was the smartest girl in her class and she was passionate about anything that involved mathematics. With that being said, the summer of third grade was an especially exciting one for her- for she received a special invitation to join a math exploration camp in one of Brooklyn’s most beloved parks; Prospect Park.

The First Day
Melanie was ecstatic when she arrived at the math exploration camp. It was like nothing she had ever seen before- there were people of all ages, focused on problem-solving and getting inspired by math in all its forms. Melanie was eager to meet the campers, but was more excited to take part in the activities and explore with her mind. With a skip in her step, she ran off to the first activity- a scavenger hunt in Prospect Park. Off she went with a curious and eager mind, ready to put her math skills to the test.

The Scavenger Hunt
Melanie was having a great time solving the clues in the scavenger hunt. She knew that the answers were all around her, and was figuring out the problems quite quickly. Most of the challenge was in getting the clues to the right places, which was pretty easy for a smart 8 year old like her. Then, to her surprise, she came across an obstacle that tested her math skills to the max.

The Challenge
Melanie quickly realized that she was standing at the center of a complex web of equations. She had no idea why a scavenger hunt would involve math, but it was pretty exciting. Trying to figure out the answers was quite difficult, and Melanie soon found herself shaking with frustration. She tried hard to keep her cool, but found that she was unable to solve the questions no matter how much she tried.

The Inspiration
Suddenly, Melanie remembered her favorite quote: “Nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it”. She took a deep breath and began to look for her own unique way of solving the equations. It was then that she realized that the web of equations could be broken down into simpler problems, which she could tackle one by one. So for the next few hours, Melanie worked tirelessly to solve the equations.
